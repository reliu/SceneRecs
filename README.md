# SceneRecs
This project is a mobile app for REI and uses Salesforce Einstein Vision API. You can upload an image of a place and receive suggestions on what to wear there! 

## Getting Started

Make sure to upload your own Bearer Token into ViewController.swift. You can generate one [here](https://api.einstein.ai/token).

## Usage
The app currently only supports images that map to traveling, swimming, and paddling REI apparel categories. These include:
```
["Airplane interior", "Airport check-in", "Airport exterior", "Airport terminal",
"Highway", "Hotel lobby", "Hotel room", "Bus or train interior, "Beach or shoreline", "Pool", "Natural water"]
```
